    <!--Tips to note-->
    <h3>Tips</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The grilled turkey needs time to absorb the flavors. Marinate for at least 30 minutes</li>
        <li>Pat it Dry Before Grilling: Before placing the turkey on the grill, gently pat the surface of the meat dry with paper towels</li>
        <li>Don't Overcook: Turkey breast is very lean and dries out easily.</li>
        <li>Don't Crowd the Wok: If you are making a large batch, fry the rice in two smaller batches. Crowding the wok will lower the temperature, causing the rice to steam instead of fry.</li>
        <li>Add Sauce Last: Only add the soy sauce and sesame oil after the rice has been heated through and the vegetables are cooked. Pouring the sauce on cold rice can make it soggy.</li>
    </ul>
